0. Setup python environment.
source ROOT_ENV
python3 -m venv py-env
source py-env/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip3 install uproot numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
pip3 install jupyterlab
pip3 install xgboost slugify
pip3 install tensorboard

1. Run zgamma_preprocess.py
  Output: 
  - Flat ntuples for bkg
  - Flat ntuples for signal

2. Run split_ntuples.py: Makes ntuples for training and testing.
   Since it is hard to control training/test sample size in TMVA, make samples in split_ntuples.
  Input: 
  - Flat ntuples for bkg
  - Flat ntuples for signal
  Output: 
  - signal train sample
  - bkg train sample
  - signal + bkg test sample
  - signal + bkg train sample

3. Run train_tmva.py to train tmva. Use 2 events for test sample to be able to save 'train' sample.
  Input: signal + bkg train sample
  Output: tmva root file

4. Run use_tmva.C to apply on testing sample
  Input: 
  - signal + bkg test sample
  Output: root that has test_tree and train_tree

5. Train nn with train_nn,py. 

6. Train bdt with train_bdt.py.
