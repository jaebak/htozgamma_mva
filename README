0. Setup python environment.
source ROOT_ENV
python3 -m venv py-env
source py-env/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip3 install uproot numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
pip3 install jupyterlab
pip3 install xgboost slugify
pip3 install tensorboard

1. Run zgamma_preprocess.py
  Output: 
  - Flat ntuples for bkg
  - Flat ntuples for signal

2. make_same_shape_using_weights.py for background
   make_matching_branch_signal.py for signal

3. Run split_ntuples.py: Makes ntuples for training and testing. 
   Since it is hard to control training/test sample size in TMVA, make samples in split_ntuples.
   Run it two times. One time for full window. One time for higgs mass window.
  Input: 
  - Flat ntuples for bkg
  - Flat ntuples for signal
  Output: 
  - signal train sample
  - bkg train sample
  - signal + bkg test sample
  - signal + bkg train sample

4. split_kfolds.py: Split train sample by k-folds to be used for finding average performance
  Input: signal + bkg train sample
  Ouptut: k samples in ntuples_kfold

5. Run train_tmva_run2.py, train_tmva_raw.py to train tmva. 
  Input: signal + bkg train sample
  Output: tmva root file

6. Run use_tmva.C to apply on testing sample
  Input: 
  - signal + bkg test sample
  Output: root that has test_tree and train_tree

7. Train nn with train_nn,py. 

8. Train bdt with train_bdt.py.
